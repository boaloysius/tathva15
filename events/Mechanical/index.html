Failing to meet the prescribed requirements would result in direct disqualification from the event.
 </li>
							<li>Each team will be given two chances for each round and the best performance among them would be considered for the calculation of points.</li>
						    <li>In the case of any damage to their aircraft during a flight run, the participants are allowed to make adjustments and modifications prior to their next chance, ensuring that not more than 50% of the original aircraft is changed. </li>
						    <li>In the case of any damage to their aircraft during a flight run, the participants are allowed to make adjustments and modifications prior to their next chance, ensuring that not more than 50% of the original aircraft is changed. </li>
						    <li>The team will be disqualified if the aircraft enters the no fly zone i.e. if it reaches outside the arena, in both the flight runs.</li>
						    <p><br><br>Round 1
<br><br>1. The teams are expected to hand launch their aircraft, from a height of approximately 27ft, and safely land it in the landing zone (described by an arena of three concentric circles). 
<br>2. Landing will be considered where the aircraft first touches the ground.
<br>3. The time of flight will not be considered for the calculation of points. But if it exceeds 45s, no points will be awarded.
<br>4. If the team fails to land their aircraft inside the arena provided, in both the chances, they will be disqualified.
<br>5. Only one team member is allowed to pilot the aircraft during this round.
<br>6. A team member, other than the pilot, is supposed to launch the aircraft.

<br><br>Round 2
<br><br>1. The team is expected to launch the aircraft from the takeoff/landing zone at the ground level, reach the farthest possible check post, take a U turn and land it safely in the same region of launch, within 90s.
<br>2. Landing will be considered where the aircraft first touches the ground.
<br>3. Flight time between the launch and landing of the aircraft will be considered for the 
calculation of points in this round. Least time of flight will be the most favourable.
<br>4. The team is allowed to change its pilot, if required, but not in the middle of any flight. 
<br>5. A team member, other than the pilot, is supposed to launch the aircraft.

					<h2>AQUA STRIKE</h2>
					<h3>Incredible performance for powerful apps</h3>
					<p>Water rockets have been a source of entertainment and education for many years. They are usually made with an empty two-litre plastic soda bottle by adding water and pressurizing it with air for launching. This is an event where a team has to demonstrate the performance of their water rocket.</p>
					<div class="inst">
						<h2>TEAM SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
						<p>•	A maximum of three members are allowed per team.
<br>•	Team members have to produce valid ID card of the institute.
<br>•	There can be students from different educational institutes in a single team.
</p>
						<h2>DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
						<p>•	It must be a single stage water rocket. Multiple stages are not allowed.
<br>•	The rocket body should be made only with plastic bottles of aerated soft drinks of maximum capacity 2.25L and should be free of any fabrication failures or dents caused by heat exposure.
<br>•	The water rocket must use only compressed atmospheric air as its source of energy. Pressure compressors (foot pump) shall be provided at the venue. The pressure inside the container (rocket body) before launch should not exceed 60 psi for the first two rounds.
<br>•	Water to be filled in the rockets will be provided by the organizers. The amount of water to be used is left to the choice of the team.
<br>•	Each team must have their own launchers. No two/more teams can use a same launcher.
<br>•	The rocket must be launched from a stationary position using a fixed launcher. Slingshots, trebuchets, catapults, cannons, and all other forms of launcher boost assists are strictly forbidden. In other words, the internal pressure of the rocket must be the only source of energy for the rocket.
<br><br>The team will be disqualified if
<br>o	The rocket blasts before launch.
<br>o	The rocket is found dangerous to launch by the organizers.
<br>o	Any part breaks off from the rocket during flight.

						</p>
						<h2>EVENT LAYOUT</h2>
						<p>There will be 3 rounds. The three rounds will be testing the capability as better missile designers.
<br>ROUND 1: RANGE TEST<br>
The missiles are being tested for maximum range. The testing site will be a rectangular ground. Tentative test site is being shown. Each team will be asked to launch their missiles from one of the two launching stations. The missile must land inside the rectangular box(between lines A&B in case of 150+). The missiles are then graded into 50+,60+,...,140+,150+ according to the range they cover. Deviations are not being taken into account for scoring. The top 10 teams will be chosen for the next round. Each team will have 2 chances to try out this test and the best of the 2 will be chosen for score. TOP 10 will be chosen for the next round. Maximum points that can be scored in this round are 90.
<br>ROUND 2: ACCURACY TEST<br>	
Here each team will be asked to launch the missiles onto a specific target. There will be 3 targets at different ranges .Teams have to hit on any of the three according to their choice. The targets will be at 50m,70m and 90m all having 3 concentric circles of diameters 6m, 4m and 2m respectively. There will be 2 chances for each team in this round and the points are added up; thereby making the maximum points attainable in this round 60*2=120. The teams will be ranked based on the total of their final scores in Round 1 and Round 2. TOP 3 will be selected for the final round.
<br>ROUND 3: PRECISION TEST<br>
In this round a team's precision is evaluated by allowing their rockets to fire at five different circles at different distances with different circle diameters from a fixed single launching point. The targets will be at a distance of 25m, 35m, 50m, 70m, 90m, and the diameter of circles at each target is 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 6m respectively. However the teams have to launch the rockets on to the targets in a fixed random order for all the teams who have been qualified for the final round.( For example, the random order of targets can be target 3, target 5, target 2, target 1, target 4). The random order and the point distribution will be announced to the participants by the event managers before the start of final round.

</p>
						<h2>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
						<p>•	All the teams getting selected to final round (Top 3 in round1+round2) are assured cash prize.
<br>•	Team numbers will be assigned to the teams prior to the event . Team numbers will be written onto the rockets using a permanent marker.
<br>•	First two rounds will be conducted on 1st day, and the final round will be on the second day.
<br>•	For the final round teams may/may not bring their ready made rockets. Teams have a night to build their rockets. Few bottles can be provided if asked. Other common items like tapes, adhesives etc are available in the nearby shops.
<br>•	Team members must clear any doubts related to the final round before its start.
<br>•	Final round being new may be altered in its structure/cancelled during the course of the event for matching time, safety, space or any other constraints.
<br>•	In the event of a dispute event managers will be making impartial decisions.All the decisions made collectively by the event managers will be final.
