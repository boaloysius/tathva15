					<h2>THE BOARD ROOM</h2>
					<h3>“Marketing is telling the world that you are a Rockstar. Content Marketing is telling the world that you are the one” - Robert Rose</h3>
					<p>This is an event for all those who have a flair to sell anything under the sky. It is easy to speak to customers but hard to convince them. If you are better at the latter then this is the place for you to be in. This is a platform where you can demonstrate how innovative and imaginative you can be and how you can convince buyers into buying your product. The participants will have an enriching experience by battling out in this battle of marketing wits. Here we are inviting the students to show their skills of persuasion, presentation and imagination to market a product and persuade “THE BOARD ROOM” because “Logic will get you from a to z, but imagination will get you everywhere”.</p>
					<div class="inst">
						
					
<h2>Participation:</h2>
<br><p>A team should consist of 2 to 4 members.</p>
<br><h2>Prelims:</h2>
<br><p>The first round tests the basic knowledge of the participants on business and industries (company names, brand names, logos, slogans, current business news and everything related to business and tech- biz). A set of 15 questions will be given.
This will be an elimination round.</p>
<br><h2>Second round:</h2>
<br><p>How good are you at empathizing with ads? The classic ones, the new ones, the funny ones, the witty ones, the thoughtful ones and all the ones! This is a place where we get to know how much time you spent watching the ads between your favourite shows. And don’t worry! You won’t be called names if you did. ;)
In this second round we will show some video clips or flyers of ads and participants have to identify the related brand to that advertisement. Selected teams will qualify for the final round.</p>
<br><h2>Final Round / The Board Room:</h2>
<br><p>After second round, the selected teams would be given a product and you have to come up with a marketing plan.
You should come up with a marketing plan and it should consist of:</p>
<ul>
				 			<li>Name of the product</li>
							<li>Tagline for it. </li>
							<li>Design of the package of the product (Wrapper for the Product). </li>
							<li>Details related to market & customer segmentation to which the product is expected to be launched. </li>
						
							
					</ul>
<br><br><h2>Marketing strategies:</h2>
<br><p>Advertising: Different forms of expression like a short skit, jingles, slogans, banners or any other innovative form (care to be taken that they are not offensive or vulgar) can be used to advertise your product. The performance is judged based on the clarity in thought, attentiveness, humour, team co-ordination and expression. A maximum of 15 minutes will be given for the presentation. Points will be deducted for exceeding the time limit. The presentation will follow a 10 minute question and answer round from the judges as well as the audience. The decision taken by the judges would be final and participants will have to abide by it.</p>

					<h2>THE HEADHUNT</h2>
					<h3>“The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by a sudden flight, but they, while their companions slept, were toiling upward in the night.”
- HW Longfellow
</h3>
					<p>It’s not easy to be the head of any organisation as much as it is not easy to hunt down a suitable candidate to head an organisation. Be it SatyaNadella of Microsoft or SunderPichai of Google, there’s no exception of exemplary management skills when it comes to being in the top management of any concern. Here’s your chance to show us that you’re the best of the best when it comes to management. Welcome aboard!</p>
					<div class="inst">
						<h2>SPECIFICATIONS </h2>
						<p>Round 1:
<br><br>You need to prove it before the crowd that you know more about the business realm than anyone in town, don’t you? Here’s our way of testing how much of a biz wiz you are! This round will have a quiver of arrows shot at you which can be dodged if your knowledge of the business arena is sound enough. C’mon! Get ready to show us what you’ve got.
This will be an elimination round and the number of contestants that qualify to the next round will hold a ratio with the total number of contestants.
<br><br>Round 2:
<br><br>Not everyone can perform good with a team of strangers: or at least, so we believe and we want you to market the team player in you by participating in a team activity which is going to be much more fun than the first round.
Before you generalize, let’s make it clear: No! It’s NOT a clichéd round of Group Discussion. It’s going to be quite a challenging round with an activity that you’ll love to do as a team while providing you a shot at making friends out of strangers before you walk out of our glorious NITC!
Remember that event organized at your college where you effectively managed the finance? Hold on to that achievement! All that you learned then by doing your best or worst is going to lend helping hands here. You’ll be given a hypothetical situation of managing a crisis related to one or a few aspects of management and how you perform and get along with the other contestants will decide your advancement to the next round.
This round won’t keep you engaged for long. 30 minutes will be what you need and it’s our duty to ensure that those are the best 30 minutes you’ve had in a while!
 
 
 
 
 
<br><br>Round 3:
<br><br>What’s a management event without a marketing round? We know that your skills aren’t just limited to answering quizzes and solving crises. You might have to write CTCs, captions, prepare flyers to advertise and even write a promotion strategy for the product you’re given! It doesn’t really matter if you do or don’t speak Shakespearean but remember, ‘Brevity is the soul of the wit.’ And don’t worry you’ll have a couple of hours to do them all. And while you’re at it, you can pick some time out of it to check out other cool stuff in the campus too!
<br><br>Final Round:
<br><br>You might have a lot of reasons to get stressed and a whole lot of ways to relieve yourselves off your stresses. Espresso, Chai, Chocolates, you name it! But here’s how we get to know how much of stress can be harnessed by you! This will be a typical stress interview with the interviewers trying to petrify you! But as long as you’ve your mug of espresso beside you, worry not! You’re gonna be fine! On top of that, you stand the chance of being crowned the winner!
